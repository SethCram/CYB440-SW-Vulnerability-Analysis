#Sample2

## Description
This service recreates an openssl style server utilizing a made up transport layer called (Some Layer Security) (SLS) inspired by Transport Layer Security (TLS).  On top of that, the server implements a Message-based SLS protocol (MSLS). Since many SSL style connections can lay dormant for a long time, this server implements a "are you there?" message exchange as part of the MSLS protocol, for fun we say we are checking for the heartbeat of the partner in the SSL communciation.  

### Feature List
This service accepts messages of several types:
  Handshake, Error, Changespec, Application, Heartbeat, and Shutdown. 
The handshake protocol is similar to a TLS handshake and contains the following exchange:
  Client Hello -> 
  <- Hello Verify
  Client Hello (w/cookie) ->
  <- Server Hello
  <- Server Key Exchange
  <- Hello Done
  Client Key Exchange ->
  Hello Done ->
  <- Finished
  Finished ->

Once a handshake is complete a connection is established and future data is sent within that protected connection. All 'encryption' is a simple xor based algorithm using the exchanged keys. 

Once a secure connection is established, this service provides access to a message board. Application messages can be sent within the encrypted connection of the following types: 
  APPLICATION_LIST_BOARD - List the number of messages
  APPLICATION_POST_MESSAGE - Post a new message
  APPLICATION_DELETE_MESSAGE - Delete a message
  APPLICATION_CLEAR_BOARD - Clear the entire board
  APPLICATION_READ_MESSAGE - Read a particular message
